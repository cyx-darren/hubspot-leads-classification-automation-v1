"Enhance the attribution analysis by analyzing email content and subject lines to correct misattributions. Add these new features:

1. **Add a new column 'drill_down' that provides campaign-level detail**

2. **Create email content analyzers that override attribution based on email text:**

   A) PPC CAMPAIGN DETECTION (from subject lines):
      - If subject contains 'You've Got a New Enquiry! (Lanyard LP)' → 
        * Set attributed_source = 'PPC'
        * Set drill_down = 'Google Ads - Lanyard Campaign'
      - Add patterns for other campaign identifiers you find

   B) PAYMENT EMAIL DETECTION (change to Direct):
      - Search email content for payment-related phrases:
        * 'Payment scheduled'
        * 'Payment has been released'
        * 'remittance advice'
        * 'payment is currently routing for approval'
        * 'provide your latest SOA'
        * 'for our checking and payment'
      - If found → attributed_source = 'Direct' (existing customer)
      - Add analysis_notes = 'Payment-related communication'

   C) REPEAT CUSTOMER DETECTION (change to Direct):
      - Search for repeat customer indicators:
        * 'have ordered * from you' (regex pattern)
        * 'Hi [Name],' at email start (personal greeting)
        * 'our last order was'
        * 'ordered before'
        * 'you still have our artwork'
      - If found → attributed_source = 'Direct'
      - Add analysis_notes = 'Repeat customer identified'

   D) REFERRAL DETECTION (change to Referral):
      - Search for referral phrases:
        * 'got your contact from my colleague'
        * 'taken over * from [Name]'
        * '[Name] shared your details'
        * '[Name] kindly shared'
        * 'my colleague * who printed'
      - If found → attributed_source = 'Referral'
      - Extract referrer name if possible
      - Add to drill_down = 'Referral from [Name]'

3. **Create new analysis columns:**
   - email_content_override (TRUE if attribution changed based on email)
   - override_reason (why the attribution was changed)
   - original_attributed_source (preserve the original before override)

4. **Processing order:**
   - First: Check subject for PPC campaigns
   - Second: Check email content for payment/repeat/referral
   - Third: Apply overrides with highest confidence
